## Overview

This is a shared convention for organizing your documents.

Fumadocs MDX, and other file-system based content sources generate slugs and page trees depending on your file structure.
Meaning that you can customise the sidebar and other navigation elements by changing the file structure.

## File

A [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) or Markdown file.

### Frontmatter
 

By default, it includes:

| name          | description                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`       | The title of page                                  |
| `description` | The description of page                            |
| `icon`        | The name of icon, see [Icons](#icons)              |
| `full`        | Fill all available space on the page (Fumadocs UI) |

You may extend your content source to add additional properties.
